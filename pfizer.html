  <h2>Enhancing the Digital Operations Center</h2>
    <p>The Digital Operations Center (DOC) is Pfizer’s suite of applications that digitizes, standardizes, and simplifies the day-to-day operations at the manufacturing plants.
    My job focused on managing the enhancement requests to DOC, defining the process for the intake of the enhancements, and communicating this process to the business stakeholders worldwide.
    Throughout my internship, I worked with a collaborative tool called Stormboard, which helped in generating, organizing, and prioritizing the enhancement requests submitted by the business representatives through usage of digital sticky notes.
    This tool was helpful in providing complete transparency to Pfizer’s stakeholders and making sure their needs were being met while they used DOC.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Once the enhancement requests were accepted into the development phase, I wrote user stories in Jira, another collaborative platform that allowed me to define the requirements for each new enhancement. From there, I took these Jira stories and provided a demo to the stakeholders on what new features and functionalities would be released and how to use them in DOC.</p>
