  <h2>SI 487: USER EXPERIENCE FINAL PROJECT<br>
  TIMELINE: SEPTEMBER 2019-PRESENT<br>
  LOCATION: ANN ARBOR, MI</h2>
  </div>
  <div class= "glwsc" id="details">
  <h2>Client Mission</h2>
  <p>The Great Lakes Water Safety Consortium (GLWSC) is a 501c3 nonprofit organization based in Ann Arbor, with a mission to help people safely enjoy the Great Lakes, and a long-term vision of ending drowning. The ultimate goal of GLWSC is to keep people safe in the Great Lakes by providing life-saving information and easily accessible resources.</p>
  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>GLWSC wants to build better communication strategies based on user research and feedback. Further, GLWSC is aiming to improve its information-sharing abilities through its website and social media with the goal of reaching a larger audience. To be most impactful, GLWSC needs to know who its target users are and their needs/interests to understand how to best serve them. Overall, GLWSC wants to have a more effective online presence on their website, but also wants to explore out of the box ways to reach people with its important messages.</p>
  <h2>Project Background</h2>
  <p>About 8 years ago, Jamie Racklyeft was swimming in Lake Michigan when he was caught in a rip current and almost drowned. Nearly 45 minutes later, a 16-year-old boy was swimming in the same area where Jamie had been rescued and was swept up into the same rip current and drowned. Jamie was greatly impacted by his near-death experience and has therefore dedicated himself to spreading awareness about rip current dangers in the Great Lakes by founding the Great Lakes Water Safety Consortium, which now has more than 500 members from the United States and Canada. The team works with Jamie, as well as a past UMSI Master’s student, Aalap Doshi who is tasked with implementing recommendations the team makes.</p>
  <p>Another important piece of context is the assumption that the information provided by GLWSC is going from adults to children. Children are most at risk for drowning but are not the primary users of GLWSC resources. Drowning is the leading cause of accidental death in children ages 1-4. The team will keep this communication dynamic in mind when recommending design changes. </p>
  <h2>Project Goals</h2>
  <p>The team’s first goal for this project is to understand their users and their needs, in hopes of reaching a broader audience and providing the most beneficial means of communication and engagement. A redesign of the current GLWSC website will be proposed after conducting user research, testing, and prototyping. The GLWSC is also interested in any recommendations to improve the effectiveness and reach of their social media accounts. The team is particularly looking for solutions that combine these two goals.</p>
  <h2>Research Goals & Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>What methods of communication and engagement would aid users in their experience of the GLWSC?</li>
    <li>How do users currently interact with GLWSC?</li>
    <li>What is a user hoping to get out of coming to the GLWSC website?</li>
    <li>How might GLWSC inspire users to care more about water safety?</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Research Plan and Methods</h2>
  <div class="research">
  <h3 class="surveys">Surveys</h3>
  <p>The team’s survey will aim to gain an understanding of the target audience, their expectations, and their goals. The survey will aid in capturing the experience of a large group of users in a short time period. This survey will be administered to the GLWSC membership user group, and will be featured in the GLWSC’s weekly newsletter, The Wave. The survey will also be administered to parents, teachers, lifeguards, and those who live near Great Lakes outside of the GLWSC membership. The team hopes to unveil more about the user base that the GLWSC currently doesn’t have the data for, such as demographics and behaviors. Additionally, the survey may unveil certain users who may have valuable input for future interviews. As a result, the team hopes to answer the research questions concerning how users currently interact with GLWSC and what methods of communication they prefer.</p>
  <h3 class="interviews">Interviews</h3>
  <p>Interviews are an ideal research method to better understand how and why someone chooses to go to the GLWSC website and determine what would make this experience the most beneficial for them. The team hopes to uncover how the GLWSC might be able inspire users to care more about water safety with these more personal conversations. Having interviews after the surveys are distributed makes it so these higher end research questions like this get answered. Once the survey is sent out and finished, we can move forward with interviews through the phone, video calls, or in person. The team is aware that since many participants are from the Great Lakes region, interviews may need to be conducted remotely.</p>
  <h3 class="recruitment">Recruitment</h3>
  <p>The GLWSC has over 500 individuals in their current membership who will receive the survey via the weekly newsletter. The survey will also be sent to various Facebook groups to receive responses from those who care for children such as teachers, parents, and life guards. Responses from the survey will help inform who might be interested in participating in interviews that have relevant information to share. There is a question at the end of the survey that a user can answer ‘yes’ to indicate they would like to take place in an interview. </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Research Results</h2>
  <p>The team completed 8 interviews and plans to interview more participants after the first round of research analysis. These interview participants were a mix of the client’s potential users including babysitters, parents, police officers, and a leader of an aquatic safety program. So far, the survey that was sent has reached over 320 responses.</p>
  <h2>Analysis Methods</h2>
  <p>The team compiled all relevant findings from the interview transcriptions and created an affinity diagram containing relevant ideas and quotes. Additionally, the team analyzed the results of the survey with various report functions of Qualtrics. These included cross-referencing questions to find correlations and creating charts in excel to view our findings.</p>
  <h2>UX Requirements</h2>
  <p>The client has asked that the team make social media recommendations that can reach a broad audience and to improve the GLWSC website to be a modern, engaging experience. Below are the functional, user, and business requirements to fulfill these overarching goals and user needs uncovered by research.</p>
  <h3>Functional Requirements (ordered by priority)</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Design recommendations must be compatible with the capabilities of Squarespace.The GLWSC uses Squarespace to host their website. For now, all design recommendations should be possible to achieve using that service.</li>
    <li>There is a lack of resources at the Great Lakes Water Safety Consortium. There are not many staff members at GLWSC, so who will be making the informational videos? Who will be keeping social media up to date? Who will take the time to answer questions regarding the website or water safety?</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>User Requirements (ordered by priority)</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Give users a simple and memorable user experience by displaying water safety information effectively and efficiently. According to feedback from our interviewees, the majority stated they would benefit from seeing little blurbs/quick facts of water safety information. Simple information is easier to remember and would be most helpful if one is ever in danger in the water or needs to help someone else.</li>
    <li>Craft engaging features across GLWSC website and social media.Surveys and interviews show the vital role social media plays in the users lives, and how it would be beneficial for them to learn more about water safety via helpful social media posts. GLWSC’s social media should be accurate, up to date, and provide incentives to draw viewers to visit the website to find out more relevant information.</li>
    <li>Provide tailored resources to best fit the needs of different groups.For example an infographic specifically for babysitters on how to properly teach water safety to specific age groups, and what to do in the event of an emergency. Since it’s known that different age groups have different levels of knowledge and comfortability of sharing water safety advice, personalized resources would be a way to address these different viewpoints.</li>
    <li>Clearly display download capabilities and functionalities of the website.Currently, resources like posters and brochures within the site do not have a clear download or print functionality. This is concerning, because a user is not likely to find this hidden capability. Users must be able to come to the website and know what can be done within it regarding sharing, printing, or downloading resources.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Business Requirements (ordered by priority)</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create branding and transparency that inspires trust from users.</li>
    <li>Keep people engaged and up to date with water safety and drowning prevention.</li>
    <li>Craft a clear call to action.Successful safety campaigns have several actions that their website and social media that convince their audience to engage with their safety strategies.</li>
  </ol>
